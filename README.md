Contents\
The repository contains eight data files and three code files. We include four species groups in our analysis: grassland birds, non-grassland birds, insectivorous birds and non-insectivorous birds. There are two samples for each of the bird species groups, and one is at the county level (“_county”) and one is at the Crop Reporting district level (CRD) (“_CRD”). “fips” and “year” identify each observation in the county level dataset, and “crd” and “year” in the CRD level dataset. Please download the data and code files in the same folder and follow the instructions in the code file.
